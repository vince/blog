Greycloak is a blog about technology, business, and doing the right thing. It exists primarily as a repository of [tutorials](/categories/tutorial/) for my own benefit, but occasionally I write [opinions](/categories/blog/) on various things tech. I hope you find it useful. Feel free to share or copy anything here but leave a link to the original material if you can.

Greycloak is maintained by Vince Wadhwani. Contacting me is easiest via [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/vwadhwani). It's powered by [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) using the [Cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) Dark theme.
